-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Test framework:
   Test::Unit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Starting URL: 
   Heroku: http://empty-ice-6414.heroku.com/
   local RubyMine: http://localhost:3000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Commands to run:

   In Heroku, go to:
   http://empty-ice-6414.heroku.com/
   However, there are some trouble viewing all functions in Heroku, you can only see basic pages without any .css decoration. We have created the first user who is the administrator with username: admin, password: 123.(In case of other users' input error)

   In RubyMine, please download project1_modified.zip, choose "Development: depot1" and click "Run"(which is a green arrow). Then start Mozilla Firefox and input "http://localhost:3000", you will go to the homepage. Please notice that: only RubyMine can display all features that we did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. Extra functionalities except requirements:
(1) You can view your username when you log in, and logout anytime using the button.
(2) You can view whether you are the administrative user on the left.
(3) We used .css file to beautify the web page, and add logo.(This cannot be displayed in Heroku)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. Guide:
(1)If you create user by clicking "Create User" on the left, the default is normal user. Or if you want to login as an administrator, you should login name: admin, password: 123

(2)In the "Home" page, there is a list of posts just for briefly review. Please go to "Post and Reply" to post topics, reply topics, search topics or vote topics and replies.

(3)Normal users can only post topics, reply topics, search topics, vote topics and replies(at most once for each topic or reply, but cannot vote user's own topic or reply).
Administrative users can create other administrative users by clicking "Create User" and check "admin" box, delete users by clicking "Users".

(4)Topics are displayed according to the following rule: Order = Vote_num * 24 * 60 * 60 - (Time.now - created_at). 
This is a rule that the larger the "Order" is, the more front this topic will appear. Order is decided by vote number(one vote equals 24 hrs) minus time elapsed(in second). If Order = 0, this topic will be hidden.
